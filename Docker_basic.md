## **Introduction to Docker**
Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using **containerization**. It enables developers to package applications along with their dependencies into a **lightweight, portable container** that can run consistently across different environments.

Before Docker, applications were typically run on **virtual machines (VMs)**, which required an entire guest OS for each instance. Docker solves this inefficiency by using **containers**, which share the host operating system but remain isolated from each other.

---

## **Fundamentals of Docker**
### **1. What is a Container?**
A **container** is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes:
- The application code
- Libraries and dependencies
- Environment variables
- Configuration files

Containers run **isolated** from the host system but share the same OS kernel, making them **more efficient** than traditional VMs.

ðŸ”¹ **Key Benefits of Containers:**
- **Portability** â€“ "Works on my machine" problem is eliminated.
- **Lightweight** â€“ No need for a separate OS for each instance.
- **Scalability** â€“ Can be easily scaled across different environments.
- **Security** â€“ Each container runs in isolation.

### **2. Docker Architecture**
Docker follows a **client-server architecture**, consisting of the following components:

#### **A. Docker Engine**
Docker Engine is responsible for running and managing containers. It has three main components:
1. **Docker Daemon (`dockerd`)**  
   - Runs in the background and manages containers.
   - Handles API requests from the Docker CLI or other applications.

2. **Docker CLI (`docker`)**  
   - A command-line tool to interact with Docker.
   - Allows users to run, stop, and manage containers.

3. **Docker API**  
   - Provides a REST API for third-party applications to interact with Docker.

#### **B. Docker Objects**
Docker operates using several key objects:
1. **Images** â€“ Read-only templates that contain the application code and dependencies.
2. **Containers** â€“ Running instances of a Docker image.
3. **Volumes** â€“ Persistent storage for containers.
4. **Networks** â€“ Allow communication between containers.
5. **Dockerfile** â€“ A script that defines how to build a Docker image.

---

### **3. Docker Workflow**
A basic Docker workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Write a `Dockerfile`** â€“ Define how the image should be built.
2. **Build the Image** â€“ Convert the `Dockerfile` into a reusable image.
3. **Run a Container** â€“ Launch a container using the built image.
4. **Manage Containers** â€“ Monitor, stop, restart, or remove containers as needed.

---

### **4. Understanding Docker Images**
A **Docker Image** is a **blueprint** used to create containers. Images are **immutable** and stored in layers to save space.

ðŸ”¹ **Common Docker Image Commands:**
```sh
docker images      # List all available images
docker pull ubuntu # Download an image from Docker Hub
docker rmi ubuntu  # Remove an image
```

---

### **5. Working with Docker Containers**
A **Docker Container** is a running instance of an image. Containers can be started, stopped, restarted, and removed.

ðŸ”¹ **Common Docker Container Commands:**
```sh
docker ps                 # List running containers
docker ps -a              # List all containers (including stopped ones)
docker run -d nginx       # Run an Nginx container in detached mode
docker stop <container_id> # Stop a running container
docker rm <container_id>   # Remove a container
```

---

### **6. Dockerfile: Building Custom Images**
A **Dockerfile** is a script containing instructions to build a custom image.

ðŸ”¹ **Example `Dockerfile` for a Python App:**
```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a base image
FROM python:3.9

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application files into the container
COPY . .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

ðŸ”¹ **Building and Running a Docker Image:**
```sh
docker build -t my_python_app . # Build the image
docker run -d my_python_app     # Run a container from the image
```

---

### **7. Docker Volumes: Persistent Storage**
By default, when a container stops, all its data is lost. **Volumes** help store persistent data.

ðŸ”¹ **Working with Volumes:**
```sh
docker volume create my_data       # Create a volume
docker run -v my_data:/app/data my_image # Mount a volume to a container
docker volume ls                    # List all volumes
docker volume rm my_data             # Remove a volume
```

---

### **8. Docker Networking**
Docker allows communication between containers using **networks**.

ðŸ”¹ **Types of Docker Networks:**
1. **Bridge Network** (default) â€“ Used for communication between containers on the same host.
2. **Host Network** â€“ Shares the host network (no isolation).
3. **Overlay Network** â€“ Used for multi-host communication in a Docker Swarm.
4. **None Network** â€“ No network access.

ðŸ”¹ **Creating and Using Networks:**
```sh
docker network create my_network        # Create a network
docker network ls                        # List networks
docker run --net=my_network my_container # Connect container to a network
```

---

### **9. Docker Compose: Managing Multi-Container Applications**
Docker Compose allows defining multiple services in a single YAML file.

ðŸ”¹ **Example `docker-compose.yml`:**
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  db:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
```

ðŸ”¹ **Running with Docker Compose:**
```sh
docker-compose up -d   # Start the containers in detached mode
docker-compose down    # Stop and remove all containers
```

---

### **10. Docker Swarm: Container Orchestration**
Docker Swarm is a **native clustering tool** that helps manage multiple Docker hosts.

ðŸ”¹ **Key Features:**
- High Availability
- Load Balancing
- Rolling Updates

ðŸ”¹ **Basic Swarm Commands:**
```sh
docker swarm init              # Initialize a swarm
docker node ls                 # List swarm nodes
docker service create nginx    # Deploy a service in swarm mode
docker service ls              # List running services
```

---

### **11. Kubernetes vs. Docker Swarm**
Docker Swarm is **simpler** but lacks advanced features. **Kubernetes** is more powerful for **large-scale** deployments.

ðŸ”¹ **Comparison Table:**

| Feature         | Docker Swarm | Kubernetes |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| Setup         | Easy        | Complex    |
| Scalability   | Moderate    | High       |
| Load Balancing | Built-in   | Requires external setup |
| Auto-Healing  | Limited    | Advanced   |
