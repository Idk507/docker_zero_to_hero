## **Docker: A Complete Guide**  

### **What is Docker?**  
Docker is an open-source platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in a containerized environment. It enables developers to package applications along with their dependencies into a lightweight, portable container that can run consistently across different computing environments.  

---

## **Docker Architecture**  
Docker follows a **client-server architecture** consisting of multiple components:  
1. **Docker Client**  
2. **Docker Daemon**  
3. **Docker Host**  
4. **Docker Registry**  
5. **Docker Objects (Images, Containers, Storage, Networks, etc.)**

### **1. Docker Client**  
The Docker client (`docker`) is the primary interface for users to interact with Docker. It sends commands to the Docker daemon, which executes them.  

#### **Key Functions of Docker Client**:  
- The client uses the **Docker API** to communicate with the daemon.  
- It allows users to run commands such as:  
  - `docker build` → Build an image  
  - `docker pull` → Download an image from a registry  
  - `docker run` → Create and start a container  
- The client can interact with multiple daemons running on different machines.  

---

### **2. Docker Daemon**  
The Docker daemon (`dockerd`) runs in the background and manages Docker objects such as **containers, images, volumes, and networks**.  

#### **Key Functions of Docker Daemon**:  
- Listens for API requests from the Docker client  
- Creates and manages containers  
- Builds and stores Docker images  
- Handles networking and storage for containers  
- Communicates with other Docker daemons in a distributed environment  

---

### **3. Docker Host**  
A **Docker host** is the system that runs Docker and provides the necessary environment for containers. It consists of:  
- **Docker Daemon** → Responsible for managing containers  
- **Container Runtime** → Executes the containerized applications  
- **Storage** → Manages volumes and persistent data  
- **Networking** → Enables communication between containers  

Docker hosts can be:  
- Local machines  
- Virtual machines  
- Cloud instances  

---

### **4. Docker Registry**  
The **Docker Registry** stores Docker images. There are two main types of registries:  
1. **Public Registry**:  
   - **Docker Hub** is the default public registry  
   - Contains pre-built images for various applications  
   - Anyone can push or pull images  

2. **Private Registry**:  
   - Organizations can set up private registries  
   - Secure and restricted access to proprietary images  
   - Example: AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Google Container Registry (GCR), and Harbor  

#### **Key Commands for Registry**:  
- `docker pull <image>` → Download an image from a registry  
- `docker push <image>` → Upload an image to a registry  

---

## **Docker Objects**  
Docker works with various objects, including images, containers, storage, and networks.

### **1. Docker Images**  
A **Docker Image** is a lightweight, stand-alone, and executable package that contains:  
- The application code  
- Dependencies (libraries, binaries)  
- Environment variables and configurations  

Images are **read-only templates** used to create containers.  

#### **Key Commands for Docker Images**:  
- `docker images` → List available images  
- `docker pull <image>` → Download an image  
- `docker build -t <image_name> .` → Build an image  
- `docker rmi <image_id>` → Remove an image

---

### **2. Docker Containers**  
A **Docker Container** is a running instance of a Docker image. It is an isolated environment that includes everything needed to run an application.  

#### **Key Features of Containers**:  
- Lightweight → Uses the host’s OS kernel  
- Portable → Runs consistently across different environments  
- Secure → Runs in an isolated user space  

#### **Key Commands for Docker Containers**:  
- `docker ps` → List running containers  
- `docker run -d <image>` → Create and start a container  
- `docker stop <container_id>` → Stop a container  
- `docker rm <container_id>` → Remove a container  

---

### **3. Docker Storage**  
Docker provides multiple storage options to persist data:  

#### **Types of Docker Storage**:  
1. **Data Volumes**  
   - Mounted directly into the container’s filesystem  
   - Persist even if the container is deleted  
   - Command:  
     ```sh
     docker volume create my_volume
     docker run -v my_volume:/app/data my_image
     ```  

2. **Volume Containers**  
   - Separate containers specifically for storing data  
   - Independent of container lifecycle  

3. **Directory Mounts**  
   - Mount a host directory as a volume  
   - Provides direct access to files on the host system  
   - Example:  
     ```sh
     docker run -v /host/path:/container/path my_image
     ```  

4. **Storage Plugins**  
   - Connect Docker with external storage systems  
   - Examples: Amazon EBS, NFS, GlusterFS

### **4. Docker Networking**  
Docker provides networking capabilities to allow containers to communicate with each other and the outside world.

#### **Types of Docker Networks**:  
1. **Bridge (Default)**  
   - Allows multiple containers on the same host to communicate  
   - Example:  
     ```sh
     docker network create my_bridge
     docker run --network=my_bridge my_container
     ```  

2. **Host**  
   - The container shares the host’s networking namespace  
   - No isolation between container and host  

3. **Overlay**  
   - Used in **Docker Swarm** for inter-container communication across multiple hosts  

4. **None**  
   - Disables networking for the container  

5. **Macvlan**  
   - Assigns a **physical MAC address** to the container, making it appear as a separate physical device on the network
